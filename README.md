# Talks by LeSpocky

This started as Mercurial repository on Bitbucket, but in late August
2019 they announced this: 
[Sunsetting Mercurial support in Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket).

So I move this to [GitHub](https://github.com/LeSpocky/talks). You won't
see any new commits on this Mercurial repository anymore, as of November
2019 I will push all new changes to GitHub.
