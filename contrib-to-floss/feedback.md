# feedback to the "contrib to floss" talk

* a few words on commit access upstream
* one or two practical examples
    * how does a mail look with a patch in the MUA?
    * what feedback is requested?
    * show an actual pull request on github
* how much mails are sent on a typical mailing list and how to cope with
  it?
* references to research in social sciences on communication in floss
  communities?
* little hint on when it's okay to use git rebase?
* talk revisions? ;-)
